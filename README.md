# QR-parallel
Serial and parallel QR factorization of matrix, with Householder reflection and Givens rotation. Mpi and BLAS are used.

Moreover, QR iteration methods using Hessenberg matrix and Wilkinson shift are implemented.

Householder parallel implementation refer to https://github.com/zjevik/QR-decomposition

run.sh contains all necessary command.
